"4-5 points are docked when winning gives just 12 points, I feel that is just way too harsh, it needs to be reduced.\nAlso can add other implications like you can't take new ball for 90 overs rather than 80 or you can't have extra fielder, some innovative kind of solution.(4/n)"
'There are times in hot and humid conditions and teams comprise of 4 bowlers(very rare but they do) where it is just not possible to bowl all 90 overs in 6 hours or even with the extra 30 mins. Probably can analyse and reduce required rate.(3/n)'
'Teams need to be informed on a dynamic basis that they are behind the rate. Add in a graphic to tell them that, other sports do it, they stop when there is an interval. I am sure referee accounts for all that but how will players realise if they are behind or ahead of time.(2/n)'

'All these stuff have an impact but don’t define result of the match. CSK lost 4 wickets in powerplay against Mumbai and rayadu was injured so essentially 5 and still they recovered and won the game.\nPlayers feel different kind of pressure for different situations yes but that'
'What I’m getting to is that every ball has equal weightage, you can’t be like this phase we don’t care and do whatever you want. The "big moments" are moments where things that shouldn’t happen happen, best player getting out, best bowler bowling no balls.'
'Thsi was general perception that day but the next day we thought wait England didn’t utilise powerplay well bairstow only score 13(17) that must be a big moment right? If malan had stayed, given his method he’d have better way more aggressively so his wicket was a big moment.'

'Fourth: Jadeja is a brilliant player, like he’s elite but he doesn’t make it to our 11 only with his bowling, we have way better spinners, with us playing only 2 spinners both of them have to be of highest quality.'
'Third: if Varun Chakravarty one and a half season was enough to make to India squad why didn’t Siraj make it? Why was Chahal dropped if chahar wouldn’t even play?'
'Second one: sending Washington to England. Kohli has publicly stated only reason holding Ashwin from rentry Is because sundar is our best spinner, then why was he sent with test team instead of limited over series in Sri Lanka.'
